# Housing Market Dynamics: Price

## Possible Analysis:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Examine changes in property prices and rental rates over time, correlating these with fluctuations in supply (e.g., new construction) and demand (e.g., population growth or migration patterns).

- **Supply vs. Demand Heatmaps**: Create geographic heatmaps showing areas where housing demand significantly exceeds supply, resulting in price increases. Conversely, identify regions where supply is greater than demand, leading to price stagnation or decreases.

- **Interest Rate vs. Price Correlation**: Analyze how interest rate changes impact housing affordability and demand, specifically looking at how lower rates fuel demand (and increase prices) versus how higher rates suppress demand.

- **Affordability Analysis**: Compare the cost of renting vs. buying, incorporating interest rates, housing supply, and local income levels. Identify regions where affordability challenges exist due to mismatches between demand and available housing supply.

- **Demographic and Regional Trends**: Explore how supply and demand pressures differ across regions and demographics, such as how urban areas may face higher demand for rentals due to limited supply, while suburban/rural areas experience shifts in home ownership due to different affordability dynamics.

- **Construction and Supply Tracking**: Analyze rates of new home construction and compare them to housing demand in different regions. Examine how lagging construction in high-demand areas exacerbates price growth, while areas with higher supply may see stabilized or declining prices.
