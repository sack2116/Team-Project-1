# Housing Market Dynamics: Price Trends, Interest Rates, and Supply vs. Demand
# Question:
How have residential property prices and housing affordability evolved over the past 5â€“10 years across different regions (urban, suburban, rural), and how have interest rate changes and supply-demand imbalances influenced the shift between renting and home ownership?
# Purpose:
This research explores the interaction between property prices, interest rates, and housing supply and demand. It aims to understand how these factors drive affordability, regional price differences, and preferences between renting and owning homes. Identifying regions where demand is outstripping supply and analyzing how changes in interest rates affect buyer and renter behaviors will offer insight into future housing market trends and challenges.
